# Sockets

Exercise about Sockets to understand how work.
I created a file as a server an another as a client to emulate the client-server architecture.

- I did this project on linux (OS)


Use the command to compile :
> gcc -o file.out file.c

Use the command to run :
> ./file.out

- The file "server.out" must be called with a single argument which is the port to use.
- The file "client.out" must be called with two arguments, the first is the ip (In my case i used 127.0.0.1) and the second is the port to use.



***NOTE:***
The port to use must be the same to both files, in my case i used the port 9080
